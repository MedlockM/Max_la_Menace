Parameters \u00b6 G (Graph): The graph representing the train network. start_station (str): The name of the start station. end_station (str): The name of the end station. max_hops (int): The maximum number of hops allowed in the path. Returns \u00b6 all_paths (list): A list of all paths from the start station to the end station. Note: The function assumes that the graph G is already created and contains the necessary information about the train network. is_csv_exists Function \u00b6 This function is used to check if the CSV file exists. Parameters \u00b6 file_name (str): The name of the file to check. Returns \u00b6 exists (bool): True if the file exists, False otherwise. load_csv_into_dataframe Function \u00b6 This function loads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Parameters \u00b6 file_name (str): The name of the CSV file to load. Returns \u00b6 df (DataFrame): The pandas DataFrame containing the data from the CSV file. download_csv Function \u00b6 This function downloads a CSV file from a given URL and saves it to the local machine. Parameters \u00b6 url (str): The URL to download the CSV file from. file_name (str): The name to save the downloaded file as. Returns \u00b6 None filter_dataframe Function \u00b6 This function filters a pandas DataFrame based on user input and a specific column. Parameters \u00b6 df (DataFrame): The pandas DataFrame to filter. column_name (str): The name of the column to filter on. value (str): The value to filter for. Returns \u00b6 filtered_df (DataFrame): The filtered pandas DataFrame. create_graph Function \u00b6 This function creates a graph from a pandas DataFrame. Parameters \u00b6 df (DataFrame): The pandas DataFrame containing the data to create the graph from. Returns \u00b6 G (Graph): The created graph. get_unique_stations Function \u00b6 This function returns a list of unique station names from a pandas DataFrame. Parameters \u00b6 df (DataFrame): The pandas DataFrame to get the unique station names from. Returns \u00b6 stations (list): A list of unique station names.","title":"Draw"},{"location":"draw/#find_all_paths-function","text":"This function is used to find all paths from the start station to the end station in a given graph with a maximum number of hops.","title":"find_all_paths Function"},{"location":"draw/#parameters","text":"G (Graph): The graph representing the train network. start_station (str): The name of the start station. end_station (str): The name of the end station. max_hops (int): The maximum number of hops allowed in the path.","title":"Parameters"},{"location":"draw/#returns","text":"all_paths (list): A list of all paths from the start station to the end station.
